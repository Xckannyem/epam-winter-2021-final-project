### Start using the application

Python3 and PostgreSQL must already be installed

### Installing and using PostgreSQL

In case if you have some difficulties to set up the PostgreSQL database there is presented such a small tutorial (for Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04):

    1\. Download PostgreSQL: 
        * `sudo apt update`
        * `sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib`

    2\. Connect to base account (postgres is a default account): `sudo su - postgres`

    3\. Create department_db database: `createdb department_db`

    4\. Connect to the database: `psql -d department_db`

##### P.S. 
If something went wrong, or you do not want to use default postgres account you can read this tutorial:
